            <h1>About Mardi Gras</h1>
            <p>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                Celebrations
                are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday
                (the
                start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
                permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the
                last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and
                surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).

                The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
                schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the
                earliest,
                Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for
                holding
                large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities as
                grand
                marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as their
                Kings),
                as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders
                traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads,
                doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys, but throws can also
                include lingerie and more sordid items. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each
                year.

                While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street and in New Orleans and
                Dauphin, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St.
                Charles
                Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter. Mardi Gras day traditionally
                concludes
                with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus</p>
